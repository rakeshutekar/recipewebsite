    "Title": "Hard Boiled Eggs",
    "Description": "Ingredients:\n- 1 to 6 large eggs\n- 1 tray of ice cubes\n\n1. Place large pot of water on stove at high heat, enough water to cover eggs completely. Carefully lower eggs into pot and continue to boil for 30 seconds. Cover tightly, reduce heat to low (water should maintain a bare simmer), and continue cooking for 11 minutes. Serve immediately if serving hot. If serving cold, immediately place eggs in bowl of ice water and allow to cool for at least 15 minutes before peeling under cool running water.\n\n2. To peel, first gently tap hard-boiled eggs all over to thoroughly crack the shell, then remove shell under a thin stream of running water. (The water helps get under the shell and lift it off the egg.)",

    "Title": "Roasted Tomatoes",
    "Description": "- Fresh Tomatoes – washed and quartered\n- Olive Oil\n- Onion – roughly chopped\n- Garlic Cloves\n- Salt and Pepper\n\n1. Begin by preheating the oven to 450 degrees. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and place quartered tomatoes onto it. Drizzle olive oil over the tomatoes, then sprinkle on salt and pepper, amount will depend on personal preference.\n\n2. Roast the tomatoes in the oven for approximately 20 minutes, or until they start to brown on top, keep an eye on them so they don’t burn. Remove tomatoes from oven and let cool.\n\n3. Once the tomatoes are fully cooled, transfer them to a Ziploc freezer bag. Label and date the freezer bag and store for up to 6 months.",
